# Do this once:
0. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/trapclim/EAS-5555-S24.git
```
1. Navigate to wherever you cloned Carlos's repo (this might be different for your computer):
```
cd ~/EAS-5555-S24/carrillo-code/
```

2. If this is the first time you are running the updated `carrillo-code` you will need to run the bash script called `setup-code.sh` like this:
```
bash setup-ccode.sh
```

# This will handle adding the `PATH=$PATH:.` and `export PATH` lines to your `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` files.

# The line above will also change the permissions of the `.csh` files to make them exexecutables.


# OLD
# Now let's get started. 
1. First run `./get.loop.ope.csh`
